        <p>
            I'm currently a product manager @ StickerYou in Toronto, Ontario. My responsibilities are split between managing the product
            lifecycles of our 20 products, as well as work on new product development and innovation. I graduated from McGill
            University in 2017 with a Bachelors in Economics and German Language and Literature. This is where I decided
            I wanted my early career experience to be one where I help small companies grow, leading me to Venture for Canada,
            where I am a current fellow.

        </p>

            When I'm not working, I try to immerse myself into the world of music & film. I've been singing since I was four, and have
            continuously been involved with musical extracurriculars my whole life, whether that may be choir, musical theatre
            or learning to play the guitar! I'm also in the process of learning French, as one of my resolutions for this
            year is to hit the 5-languages mark.
        </p>
        <p>
            Having lived in four countries, and speaking four languages has allowed me to center my interactions and work around empathy,
            and perspective - two traits which I believe are fundamental for not only being a good product manager, but also
            a good leader. As a woman in tech, I want to consistently create and re-create spaces for women to thrive, seek
            opportunity and ultimately inspire and drive impact.
